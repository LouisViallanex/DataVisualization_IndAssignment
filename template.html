      <h3>Interpretation</h3>

      <p>
        *bodily accident involving at least one victim, a vehicle and occurring on a road open to public traffic. <br><br>

        ➔ The first figure represents a map of France with all road accidents* in 2020. We can see that it is the areas with a high population density and therefore
         high traffic that have the most accidents. I also made the same representation with fatal accidents to see if we could conclude that they were more present 
         on highways and isolated roads but no concrete conclusion was obvious. <br><br>

        ➔ The pie chart represents the proportion of drivers involved in an accident (but not their responsibility). 75% are men and 25% are women. <br><br>

        ➔ 5.48% of road accidents in France in 2020 were fatal for at least one of the victims involved. <br><br>

        ➔ The first graph represents the distribution of people involved in a road accident according to their age. It is difficult to draw conclusions from this graph
         since it would have to be related to the distribution of all drivers by age. In addition, I also produced this same graph for deceased people (and not only accidents),
          the distribution is more random and not necessarily interesting. <br><br>

        ➔ The second graph represents the distribution of the number of accidents during the months of the year 2020. We can easily observe a considerable drop during March,
         April, May and November, in particular April. This is explained by the two confinements in France (March 17, 2020 to May 11, 2020 and October 30, 2020 to December 15,
          2020), with the first confinement even stricter than the second and therefore much fewer people on the roads. <br><br>

        ➔ Finally the last graph represents the distribution of accidents during the day. The most important part is concentrated between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m. given that there
         are the most people on the road, and in particular in the late afternoon with the return from work and the accumulated fatigue of the day.

      <h3>Discussion</h3>

      <p>
        First of all, we can identify difficulties specific to visualization as such. The databases I used are substantial and we can 
        get a lot of information from them. The first work consists above all in defining what we are able to analyze with these data 
        and what we wish to observe. Then after having made several visualizations it is necessary to keep those which are the most 
        intriguing. <br><br>

        Then he has the technical difficulties that come in the background, everything that will be related to the manipulation of data 
        on python, but on this point I had much less difficulty since, unlike the visualization problems, here each problem is solvable 
        with a concrete solution.
      </p>

      <h3>Sources</h3>

      <p>
        For this data visualization work I used the official 
        <a href="https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/datasets/bases-de-donnees-annuelles-des-accidents-corporels-de-la-circulation-routiere-annees-de-2005-a-2020/">personal accident data</a>
         available on data.gouv. I used in particular the tables <a href="https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/78c45763-d170-4d51-a881-e3147802d7ee">"usagers-2020.csv"</a> and
         <a href="https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/07a88205-83c1-4123-a993-cba5331e8ae0">"caracteristiques-2020.csv"</a>, you can also find these tables, their documentation 
         and my code for the visualizations on my <a href="https://github.com/LouisViallanex/DataVisualization_IndAssignment">GitHub</a>.
